# my-animeList Songs

This is a node script that scrapes your MyAnimeList profile and get all animes you've seen already. From this anime list, it saves all songs (openings/endings) name and youtube URL into a JSON file.

For changing the scrapped profile simply change profileName value inside "config.js" file into yours.
